**1. Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.**

As defined by Brooks, essential difficulties are the difficulties inherent in the nature of software, which includes the specification, design and testing of conceptual construct when building software. No matter how technique changes, there will still be essential difficulties shown in several ways - they could be conflicts of specifications between different regulations, or the ever-changing needs from clients. 


**2. Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.**

Accidental difficulties are the difficulties related to the production of software but not inherent. These difficulties usually can be solved by technical improvements, such as bugs or crashes in software, syntax errors that can be checked and corrected by an IDE. When building a website with some frequently updated API, it is possible that our website fails to provide service all of a sudden due to the release of a newer version of that API. However, this can be easily fixed just by updating our code in accordance with its latest documentation.


**3. List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.**

The four essential difficulties of developing software systems identified are complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility. 

Complexity of developing software systems mostly comes from the large differences among numerous parts of software entities, the huge number of states, and the exponential increase in the number and types of different elements. One of the example problems deriving from complexity can be unreliability, like security loopholes and unstable service of the software due to unanticipated states.

Conformity of developing software systems comes from the arbitrary environment where software exists and must conform to, this includes different interfaces, standards or regulations. Software has to comply with these external factors before it could work.
Example:
Whenever a large system such as a programming language updates, its current developers have to maintain the consistency of all interfaces of that system in order to guarantee the system still works properly.

Changeability is the fact that software entity is constantly subject to change. The function of a software system is usually the part that has greater pressure of change, and people intuitively consider that software can be more easily changed in comparison with manufactured things. Moreover, successful software that survives longer than expected often needs to be adapted in order to work with modern environments.
Example:
At the beginning, WeChat was just a mobile app used for chatting. In order to keep up with the fast-paced changing environment, it has to develop the new features like payment functionality.

Invisibility describes that software is invisible, unvisualizable and lack of graphical representation since it’s not inherently embedded in space. Even if we could try to diagram the software structure, it turns out that we need several graphs to depict different relationships. These graphs are less hierarchical, and are unlikely to be reduced or combined into a single diagram.
Example: 
We can not show the software architecture like using architecture plan in building bridges. So it’s really hard to show the solution to client and prove which one is a better solution than others.



**4. Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.**

**5. In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.**

**6. In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.**
